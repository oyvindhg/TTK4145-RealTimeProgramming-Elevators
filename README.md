# [TTK4145 - Real-time Programming](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTK4145)

*A collaborative project with [Simon Blindheim](https://github.com/simbli)*

**Course content:** Programming formalisms for real-time systems; POSIX, Ada, Java and Go. Threads/processes, synchronization and communication. Shared variable-based synchronization and resource control. Fault Tolerance, availability and consistency. Message-based synchronization, CSP and formal methods. Exercises and project.

**Project:** Create software for controlling `n` elevators working in parallel across `m` floors, with the following requirements:
- No orders are lost
- Multiple elevators should be more efficient than one
- An individual elevator should behave sensibly and efficiently
- The lights and buttons should function as expected
Read a detailed description of all requirements at the [TTK4145 repo](https://github.com/TTK4145/Project#elevator-project).
